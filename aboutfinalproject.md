About My Final Project

I chose to use data about butterflies from MonarchWatch.org. Data was gathered in Mexico, at butterfly overwintering sites near the mountainous regions of that country. I chose to use that data, as it was the best data we currently have on the number of monarchs, outside of data that is being currently tallied by museums in several American cities, as my article specifies. I really enjoyed plotting this data. 

One should always contextualize and make sense of any data, and this is no exception. The amount of butterflies that exist and were plotted were related in football fields, as I believe the story specifies. One can understand the number of butterflies better by thinking about how many can fill up football fields, instead of just hearing a set number of so many million. I think that the most successful data stories can relate data units to common, everyday things, and that resonates more powerfully with todayâ€™s readers. The stories that were the most powerful of those presented in class were the ones that did this. Relating stories that have somewhat abstract data to the average reader and rendering that data is something that should be well-thought-out.
