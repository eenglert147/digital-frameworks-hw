This chart shows that as a percentage of total operations, the state of Washington is not a big beef producer overall. This confirms other recent data I have found, showing the state 25th out of 50 states in beef production. Today, much US beef is raised on large factory farms called CAFOS, which can have as many as 100 head of cattle. I care about this, as I am doing a story on the movement of cattle across state lines and wanted to know how active of a market the state of Washington truly was.
